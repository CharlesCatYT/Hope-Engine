    /**
     * People don't really look at internals,
     * so here's some shit about this event:
     * 
     * When this event was being made, I used
     * a library called `texter`, which included
     * an FlxInputText fork that can have Multiline,
     * Right-to-left alignment, and other fixes
     * like that.
     * 
     * When I was testing this event up, it just
     * wasnt working at all. No animations were
     * being played. The character just *froze*.
     * 
     * As a result, I almost had to put this event
     * down and say "this event is impossible".
     * 
     * I took a second look at the library I used,
     * and saw something weird.
     * 
     * The library was using an invisible character,
     * `U+200b`. Which completely just breaks 
     * everything.
     * 
     * The character would infest itself in strings
     * that are used for STRICT equality checks 
     * (like in the event editor, where if you typed 
     * a parameter with the same ID, the fields would 
     * be filled properly).
     * 
     * So I had to drop `texter` as a whole. Didn't
     * know it used EMPTY characters in the first
     * place.
     * 
     * ...not like I expected it to use them to begin
     * with.
     * 
     * =============================================
     * 
     * You can toy with the event, if you know what
     * you're doing!
